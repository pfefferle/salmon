"As updates and content flow in real time around the Web, conversations "
"around the content are becoming increasingly fragmented into individual "
"silos.  Salmon aims to define a standard protocol for comments and "
"annotations to swim upstream to original update sources -- and spawn more "
"commentary in a virtuous cycle.  It's open, decentralized, abuse resistant, "
"and user centric."
